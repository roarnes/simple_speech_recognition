# simple_speech_recognition


This is a simple one-dimensional data recognition implementation with Python as part of the Pattern Recognition course. The purpose of the system is to recognize five given commands. In this implementation, the system works such that it can recognize audio signal inputs as either one of five common genres of music, namely rock, blues, jazz, soul and pop. This system can then be used further for softwares like Spotify, Youtube, Apple Music, etc. The sample audio data, used for training, is taken manually by recording speech from four different people.
